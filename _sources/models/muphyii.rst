*muphyII* plasma simulation framework
=====================================

The *muphyII* code is a simulation framework for collisionless plasma physics and targeted at space plasmas in particular. The *muphyII* code utilizes a hierarchy of models with different inherent scales to address the separation of scales problem typically encountered in these plasmas. It allows stand-alone use of models as well as a model-based dynamic and adaptive domain decomposition and resorts to novel techniques for energy conservation, careful treatment of inner-domain model boundaries for interface coupling, and robust time stepping algorithms.

Use cases
---------

*muphyII* has already been used in the study of a number of different scenarios of magnetic reconnection and decaying turbulence simulations [7]_ [8]_ [2]_. Current developments include extension of the model hierarchy and including AMR magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models in *muphyII* with asymptotic preserving MHD-fluid coupling. Further two-fluid descriptions like a 14-moment system [9]_ or a gyrotropic fluid model might be added in the future.

Data availability
-----------------

There is no public data repository. Simulations intended to support Plasma Observatory will be made available to interested parties.

Simulations-on-demand
---------------------

Simulations are not generally offered on-demand. This excludes simulations requested for the support of Plasma Observatory.

Numerical Methods
-----------------

*muphyII* currently implements kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell, fluid 10-moment-Maxwell and fluid 5-moment-Maxwell models and provides up to five model combinations. These can be used standalone, statically coupled, or dynamically coupled. Here *static coupling* refers to prescribing a fixed model to each region, while *dynamic coupling* allows models to dynamically change in each region over the course of the simulation, based on predefined criteria that ideally identify the level of fidelity required in each spatial region [1]_ [3]_.

To account for differences of temporal scales in electron and ion physics, *muphyII* employs *electron subcycling*, i.e. the time discretization for electrons uses a smaller time step than for ions [2]_.

Maxwell's equations are solved on a Yee grid using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The fluid models use a finite volume discretization with the centrally weighted essentially non-oscillatory (CWENO) reconstruction [4]_ and Runge-Kutta (RK3) time integration [5]_ and conserve mass, momentum, and energy by design. The Vlasov equation is solved with the third-order semi-Lagrangian positive flux-conservative (PFC) finite volume scheme [6]_ and conserves mass. A maximum-entropy moment matching technique using the advection of the Maxwellian part of the distribution function with a CWENO-RK3 scheme alongside the PFC Vlasov scheme reults in conservation of momentum and energy in addition to numeric mass conservation [1]_. The integration of a third-order Active Flux kinetic solver is under development.
