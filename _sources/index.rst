This website will serve as a collection of material, tools, and references for the Numerical Simulations Working Group of the `Plasma Observatory <https://plasma-observatory.inaf.it/>`_ ESA M7 candidate mission --- a Users' Guide to the Working Group, of sorts. Our task is to support the mission proposal with plasma simulations, providing virtual spacecraft observations to assess science impact, help with mission and measurement design, and to generate nice science along the way!

This page should contain mostly overviews on topics, and the branch off to subpages.

The Working Group
-----------------

The working group members and contributors represent a diverse sampling of numerical models of geospace plasmas, ranging from global to local and fluid to fully-kinetic models. This provides the full range of scales needed to assess the cross-scale phenomena in the Earth's magnetosphere and targeted by Plasma Observatory.

The group goes by the name *Group of sImulAtioN and NumerIcal support (GIANNI)* in honor of the late Giovanni Lapenta.
