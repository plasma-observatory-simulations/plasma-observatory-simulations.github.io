The Working Group
=================

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

The working group members and contributors represent a diverse sampling of numerical models of geospace plasmas, ranging from global to local and fluid to fully-kinetic models. This provides the full range of scales needed to assess the cross-scale phenomena in the Earth's magnetosphere and targeted by Plasma Observatory.

Members & Contributors
----------------------

Maybe we list soon our members here?

VITRO
^^^^^

Capabilities
------------

Here we could start listing examples on what we can do and have done, and which models to look at for which sorts of phenomena. 

Fast turnaround data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we could describe which sorts of data we can provide quickly

Medium turnaround projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we could describe things we might be doing in near-future, but that require planning and/or new simulation runs or resources.

Slow turnaround projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we could list things that require significant new effort, e.g. new simulation runs with significant HPC resources that need to be acquired.
